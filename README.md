# AWS LAMP-Stack

**What is does**

We will create a fault tolerant WordPress site with high availability. A WP Admin will manage the site and content directly accessing on an EC2 instance that will upload both code and media to S3. Users will access the website through a load balancer to a group of EC2 instances that will download the code and media from S3. CloudFront will host and cache media files for performance.

This could be a typical small **proof of concept** example for a customer. We can use this as a real-life case study to create a fault tolerant WordPress site. We'll skip through the steps in AWS and will not document every small configuration detail. Please note this is a temporary environment and security considerations may be open. Production would use HTTPS 443 instead of HTTP port 80 and other restrictions.

**High Level Design**

**Networking & Content Delivery > VPC > Security Groups**

Create two new security groups in my default VPC
- WebDMZ - port 22, 80 - source: 0.0.0.0/0
- RDS-MYSQL/Aurora - port 3306 - source: Security group name for WebDMZ

**Database > RDS > Create database**

**MySQL â€“ version 5.7.22**

Production Template which will allow Multi-AZ DB instance

Enter a DB instance identifier name with Master name and password

For test and billing purposes we will use a T2 Micro with 20GB General Purpose SSD

Create DB instance that is not publicly accessible and in Default VPC choosing existing VPC security groups - **RDS-MYSQL/Aurora**

**S3 > Create bucket**
Create two S3 buckets
**markbradley-wp-code** / Bucket and objects not public
**markbradley-wp-media** / Public Access

**CloudFront > Distribution > Create distribution**

Create a distribution and use the S3 media bucket for the Origin Name and S3 FQDN for Origin Domain

**Security, Identity, & Compliance > IAM > Roles > Create role**

AWS service - **EC2**
Permissions policies > **AmazonS3FullAccess**
Role name: **S3forWP**

**EC2**
**Launch instance > Amazon Linux 2 AMI**
